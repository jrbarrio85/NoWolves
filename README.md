# NoWolves

Version A17-b240v3
-Changed "NoScreamer" file to "NoScreamerHordes" and updated to disable the scream that calls hordes, instead of replacing The Ring girl.

Version A17-b240v2
-Prefaced file name with author, for better folder organization. Not a neccessary update as far as features are considered.

Version A17-b240v1
-Initial upload

NEW - The Screamer is no longer replaced, instead the horde calling feature is disabled.

Remove your choice of zombie and replace it with another.
Prechosen replacements but you can change preferred replacement, via file tweak. Just pick the files you want.

Current replacement list includes:

-Dogs = Cheerleaders
-Wolves = Bikers
-Bears = Fat Cops
-Vultures = Soldiers
-Snakes = Strippers
-Wights = Burnt
-Spiders = Nurses
-Grace = Farmers
-Screamer = Not replaced, horde calling disabled

NOTE: Replacing zombies is preferred to removal, via probability, so that zombie numbers are maintained.
